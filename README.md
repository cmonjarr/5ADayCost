# Cost of 5 a Day the Color Way 

### Overview:

Colorful fruits and vegetables provide the wide range of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals your body needs to maintain good health and energy levels. For this reason it is recommended that we consume five to eight servings of fruits and vegetables of different colors daily. In the early 2000, several health departments used the slogan '5 a Day the Color Way' to promote the need of eating at least five servings of fruits/vegetables of various colors every day. Fruits and vegetables, based on their color,  are usually classified in five groups - Red, Green, Yellow/Orange, Blue/Purple, and White/tan/brown.  

### Problem:
Many people indicate that it is expensive to achieve the '5 a Day the Color Way' goal. 

### Objective:
This project will be used to generate the top 10 lowest cost combinations of achieving this goal. This will be done by using any form of fruits/vegetables - fresh, canned or frozen - and for each individual type. The goal is to compare the cost to determine the cheapest options and compare cost over years: 2016, 2020 and 2022.
