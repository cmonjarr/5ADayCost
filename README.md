# Cost of 5 a Day the Color Way 

### Overview:

Colorful fruits and vegetables provide the wide range of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals your body needs to maintain good health and energy levels. For this reason it is recommended that we consume five to eight servings of fruits and vegetables of different colors a day. In the early 2000, several health departments used the slogan '5 a Day the Color Way' to promote the need of eating at least five servings of fruits/vegetables a day.

Fruits and vegetables, based on their color,  are usually classified in five groups - Red, Green, Yellow/Orange, Blue/Purple, and While/tan/brow.  This project will be used to generate the top __ lowest cost combinations of achieving '5 a Day the Color Way'. This will be done of any form of fruits/vegetables - fresh, canned or frozen - and for each individual type.
